The APU Whale Collection: Exclusive NFTs for High-Stakes Holders

The APU Whale Collection is a rare set of 333 exclusive NFT trading cards designed for serious APU enthusiasts. Each Whale NFT costs 1 ETH, allocated as follows:

33% for APU buybacks

33% for sweeping APU NFTs

33% to fund operations

Eligibility: Only holders with 900M+ APU can mint. Selling a Whale NFT to an account with less than 900M APU will trigger a burn mechanic, maintaining exclusivity.

Minting & Selling: Minting requires proof of holdings. NFTs may only be sold to other whales. The art style reflects high-value trading cards, emphasizing prestige.

Goals:

Create an exclusive club of top APU holders

Support APUâ€™s token and NFT price growth

Attract whales from other communities

Launch Date: September 17th 2025 at 2pm EST.
